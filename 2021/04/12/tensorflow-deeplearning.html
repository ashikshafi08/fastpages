<h2 id="course-structure"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Course structure</code></h2>

<p>This course is code first. The goal is to get you writing deep learning code as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It is taught with the following mantra:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Code -&gt; Concept -&gt; Code -&gt; Concept -&gt; Code -&gt; Concept
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means we write code first then step through the concepts behind it.</p>

<p>If you’ve got 6-months experience writing Python code and a willingness to learn (most important), you’ll be able to do the course.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-do-this-course"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Should you do this course?</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have 1+ years experience with deep learning and writing TensorFlow code?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If yes, no you shouldn’t, use your skills to build something.</p>

<p>If no, move onto the next question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have you done at least one beginner machine learning course and would like to learn about deep learning/pass the TensorFlow Developer Certification?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If yes, this course is for you.</p>

<p>If no, go and do a beginner machine learning course and if you decide you want to learn TensorFlow, this page will still be here.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Prerequisites</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do I need to know to go through this course?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>6+ months writing Python code.</strong> Can you write a Python function which accepts and uses parameters? That’s good enough. If you don’t know what that means, spend another month or two writing Python code and then come back here.</li>
  <li><strong>At least one beginner machine learning course.</strong> Are you familiar with the idea of training, validation and test sets? Do you know what supervised learning is? Have you used pandas, NumPy or Matplotlib before? If no to any of these, I’d going through at least one machine learning course which teaches these first and then coming back.</li>
  <li><strong>Comfortable using Google Colab/Jupyter Notebooks.</strong> This course uses Google Colab throughout. If you have never used Google Colab before, it works very similar to Jupyter Notebooks with a few extra features. If you’re not familiar with Google Colab notebooks, I’d suggest going through the Introduction to Google Colab notebook.</li>
  <li><strong>Plug:</strong> The <a href="https://dbourke.link/ZTMMLcourse">Zero to Mastery beginner-friendly machine learning course</a> (I also teach this) teaches all of the above (and this course is designed as a follow on).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-exercises---extra-curriculum"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">🛠 Exercises &amp; 📖 Extra-curriculum</code></h2>

<p>To prevent the course from being 100+ hours (deep learning is a broad field), various external resources for different sections are recommended to puruse under your own discrestion.</p>

<p>(solutions to come after the course is released… try the exercises out for yourself first!)</p>

      <li>You can use any feature extraction layer from TensorFlow Hub you like for this.</li>
      <li>You should aim to have at least 10 images of each class, for example to build a fridge versus oven classifier, you’ll want 10 images of fridges and 10 images of ovens.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the current best performing model on ImageNet?

<ul>
  <li>Read through the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning">TensorFlow Transfer Learning Guide</a> and define the main two types of transfer learning in your own words.</li>
  <li>Go through the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning_with_hub">Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Hub tutorial</a> on the TensorFlow website and rewrite all of the code yourself into a new Google Colab notebook making comments about what each step does along the way.</li>
  <li>We haven’t covered fine-tuning with TensorFlow Hub in this notebook, but if you’d like to know more, go through the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model#fine-tuning">fine-tuning a TensorFlow Hub model tutorial</a> on the TensorFlow homepage.How to fine-tune a tensorflow hub model:</li>
  <li>Look into <a href="https://www.wandb.com/experiment-tracking">experiment tracking with Weights &amp; Biases</a>, how could you integrate it with our existing TensorBoard logs?</li>

<ol>
  <li>Write a function to visualize an image from any dataset (train or test file) and any class (e.g. “steak”, “pizza”… etc), visualize it and make a prediction on it using a trained model.</li>
  <li>Use feature-extraction to train a transfer learning model on 10% of the Food Vision data for 10 epochs using <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/EfficientNetB0"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB0</code></a> as the base model. Use the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ModelCheckpoint"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ModelCheckpoint</code></a> callback to save the weights to file.</li>
  <li>Fine-tune the last 20 layers of the base model you trained in 2 for another 10 epochs. How did it go?</li>
  <li>Fine-tune the last 30 layers of the base model you trained in 2 for another 10 epochs. How did it go?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="-05-transfer-learning-in-tensorflow-part-2-fine-tuning-extra-curriculum">📖 05 Transfer Learning in TensorFlow Part 2: Fine-tuning Extra-curriculum</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Read the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/data_augmentation">documentation on data augmentation</a> in TensorFlow.</li>
  <li>Read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">ULMFit paper</a> (technical) for an introduction to the concept of freezing and unfreezing different layers.</li>
  <li>Read up on learning rate scheduling (there’s a <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/LearningRateScheduler">TensorFlow callback</a> for this), how could this influence our model training?
    <ul>
      <li>If you’re training for longer, you probably want to reduce the learning rate as you go… the closer you get to the bottom of the hill, the smaller steps you want to take. Imagine it like finding a coin at the bottom of your couch. In the beginning your arm movements are going to be large and the closer you get, the smaller your movements become.</li>

  <li>Train a feature-extraction transfer learning model for 10 epochs on the same data and compare its performance versus a model which used feature extraction for 5 epochs and fine-tuning for 5 epochs (like we’ve used in this notebook). Which method is better?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="-06-transfer-learning-in-tensorflow-part-3-scaling-up-extra-curriculum">📖 06 Transfer Learning in TensorFlow Part 3: Scaling-up Extra-curriculum</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Spend 15-minutes reading up on the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping">EarlyStopping callback</a>. What does it do? How could we use it in our model training?</li>
  <li>Spend an hour reading about <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a>. What does it do? How might you integrate some of the things we’ve done in this notebook in a Streamlit app?</li>

<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<p>geez… I forgot how much there was still to go… classic project planning</p>

<ul>
  <li>✅ Make a GitHub Project for course (see “Projects” tab)</li>
  <li>✅ Make a <a href="https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions/3874">GitHub Discussions</a> for course (thank you <a href="https://github.com/alvarobartt">Alvaro</a>)</li>
  <li>✅ Polish GitHub readme (what you’re reading now) with extra resources:
    <ul>
      <li>data links used in course</li>
      <li>extra resources &amp; curriculum</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>🔜 Upload slides for each section, done for: 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05 (see <a href="https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning#course-materials">course materials</a>)</li>
  <li>🔜 Upload video notebooks for each section, done for: 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05 (see <a href="https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/tree/main/video_notebooks">.video_notebooks/</a>)</li>
  <li>Add a section which contains “things taught in this course”, like a table of contents kind of thing</li>
  <li>Make Colab overview video (Colab is the tool we’ll be using for the whole course)</li>
  <li>Make course resource overview video (e.g. how to use this GitHub, Discussions page, exercises, extra-curriculum etc)</li>
  <li>Upload solutions for exercises (probably livestream the creation of these after course launch)</li>
</ul>
